## 📊 Featured Projects

### Healthcare Data Breach Analysis  
**Do Business Associates Affect Breach Impact?**  
An analysis of U.S. healthcare data breach records examining whether breaches involving business associates affect more individuals than breaches without third-party involvement.

**Key skills:**  
Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, permutation testing, bootstrapping, regression modeling

### Regression & Modeling
📁 dsc630-regression-analysis  

**Key skills:**  
- OLS regression and Random Forest classification  
- Focus on model interpretation and limitations

### Pediatric Clinical Note Summarizer
**Can Specialty-Tuned Generative AI Improve Clinical Documentation?**
A generative AI project that fine-tunes an OpenAI model to transform unstructured pediatric visit notes into structured clinical summaries. The system demonstrates how specialty-specific fine-tuning can improve consistency, clarity, and usability of clinical documentation compared to general-purpose models.

**Key skills:**
Python, OpenAI API, generative AI fine-tuning, prompt engineering, dataset design, Streamlit, healthcare informatics, secure API handling

### Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Regression & Modeling
📁 ml-analysis-dsc550  
A project from the DSC 550 coursework where I explored data using regression and classification techniques to understand relationships between features and an outcome of interest. The focus was on establishing an end-to-end workflow: data cleaning, feature preparation, model building (including OLS regression and Random Forest classification), evaluating results honestly, and reflecting on model limitations. Results showed modest predictive signal in the Random Forest model (≈ 0.56 accuracy), highlighting the importance of thoughtful modeling and the limits of available features.
